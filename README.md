NID Work

The concept for the NID arose from the investigative requisite of performing network interrogation for collecting artifacts to be included for the case investigator. The NID is a dual-homed device based on the Raspberry Pi3 B+ platform. Dual-homed refers to a computer with two or more network interfaces. The dual-homed NID has an Ethernet interface and a Wi-Fi access point interface. A Wi-Fi access point is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN. An access point connects to a wired router, switch or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area.
The NID is configured as a routed Wi-Fi access point. This secure wireless network is entirely managed by the NID. A routed wireless access point can be created using the inbuilt wireless* features of the Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi Zero W, or by using a suitable USB wireless dongle that supports access point mode (recommended). It is possible that some USB dongles may need slight changes to their settings. Documentation for configuring the aforementioned aggregation of Raspberry Pi devices is located at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL): https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point-routed.md
